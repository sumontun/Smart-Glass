# Smart-Glass
Objectives
1. To design and optimize sensor electrodes for sensor embedded in glass.
   - Run electromagnetic simulation.
     - Look at the E-field.
     - Extract capacitance value.
   - Fabricate the sensor.
     - PCB prototyping machine.
   - Evaluate the sensor.
     - Use lab equipment (LCR meter) and compare to simulation.
     - Connect with a resistor and Arduino
2. To study sensitivity whether as a proximity sensor or a touch sensor.
3. To try it as a rain sensor.
